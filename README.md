# MyWork
Coding Projects I have completed since graduating.

These are the working python files and the dependent .txt files for the projects i completed for this course :

I really enjoyed these projects as an introduction to coding and computational thinking. I am currently working on coding
projects which more closely resemble real world software engineering by developing full applications.
