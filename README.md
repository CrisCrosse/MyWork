Coding Projects I have completed since graduating.

If you go to the EdX branch you can see the finished and working forms of the projects i completed for this course:

I really enjoyed these projects as an introduction to coding and computational thinking. I am currently working on coding
projects which more closely resemble real world software engineering by developing full applications.
